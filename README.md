In this game, a sigle click will display 'X' and if we want to display 'O' then, that can be done through double click.
If the cell is empty then, a single click will diplay 'X' and If the cell has already has 'X' then a single click will display 'O'.

It will make more sense once you see the code and try out by yourself.
